# Covid_Mask_Detector
This is a deep learning application which detects on a live stream if the person is wearing a mask or not

The reference for the same was taken from Prajna Bhandaryâ€™s github repo who implemented the same in Pytorch

Other references for implementing the same in tensorflow is taken from  Adrian Rosebrock

Thanks
